# Development Log — DATE  
*Thermo-Sim Project Dev Notes*

---

## 📝 Overview  
This development log captures progress, decisions, obstacles, and next steps for the Thermo-Sim project.  
Use this log entry to document what was accomplished today and what remains.

---

## ✅ Completed Today

- Initialized the `Docs/` directory for project documentation.
- Added major foundational documents:
  - `PROJECT_PLAN.md`
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md`
  - `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
  - `architecture.md`
- Established open‑source workflow and repository structure.
- Set up environment for future frontend and backend development.

---

## 🧠 Key Decisions

- Adopted React + TypeScript for the frontend.
- Selected Java + Spring Boot for backend architecture.
- Chose PostgreSQL as the database for scenarios and concept storage.
- Determined the initial simulation logic will live on the frontend for performance and simplicity.

---

## 🧩 Challenges / Notes

- Need to finalize folder names for consistency (`Docs` vs `docs`).
- Must scaffold the `frontend/` and `backend/` directories next.
- Considering options for charting libraries (Chart.js vs Recharts).
- Need to decide whether user accounts will be part of MVP or phase 2.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Create ROADMAP.md
- Begin scaffolding:
  - `frontend/` (Vite project, base React structure)
  - `backend/` (Spring Boot skeleton, health endpoint)
- Create API draft file (optional).
- Add first example simulation dataset in JSON.
- Start drafting UI wireframes for key screens.

## 📅 Additional Notes  
This file is intended to be duplicated for future logs:  
`dev-log_YYYY-MM-DD.md`  
Place all logs inside `/Docs/DevLogs/` or `/Docs/dev-log/` depending on preferred structure.
